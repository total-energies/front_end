    "answer": "The Integrated Lake Albert Resource Development Project, including the Tilenga development and the EACOP pipeline, is a project consistent with this strategy of low-dead-end projects that are the most efficient in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, the greenhouse gas emissions intensity of this project is 13 kgCO2/boe, i.e. less than 1 MtCO2eq/year at the plateau (Scope 1 + 2), corresponding to a level much lower than the current average of TotalEnergies' oil production which is of the order of 19 kgCO2/bep. These figures do not include indirect greenhouse gas emissions related to customers' use of energy products produced and sold for final use (Scope 3) from oil produced by Tilenga (and Kingfisher).",

This project's GHG emissions intensity comes to 13 kg CO2/boe, which is well below the current average of our oil portfolio of around 20 kg/boe.",

    "answer": "For example, during meetings that took place in December 2019 and January 2020, TotalEnergies EP Uganda had the opportunity to remind the authorities concerned of its commitment to respect for human rights. On 25 May 2021, TotalEnergies EP Uganda was informed by the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) that a representative of the NGO AFIEGO and a foreign journalist who were carrying out investigations with people in the area where the Tilenga project is to be developed, had been arrested by the Police in the Buliisa region of Uganda. Upon receipt of this alert from the NGO, TotalEnergies EP Uganda teams intervened with the Ugandan authorities. They also took the initiative to inform the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UN OHCHR), based in Uganda. On May 28, 2021, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TotalEnergies SE wrote a letter to the President of the Republic of Uganda to share his concerns in this regard and to request that the rights of data subjects be respected, emphasizing the importance that TotalEnergies attaches to press freedom and open dialogue with its stakeholders",
